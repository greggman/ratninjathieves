Rat Ninja Thieves
=================

<a href="http://greggman.github.com/ratninjathieveso/rat_ninja_thieves.html">Rat Ninja Thieves</a>
was developed during the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/game-developers-berlin/events/135541562/">8hr Berlin Mini Game Jam Sept 14th, 2013</a>.

The premise is there are rats running down a corridor together. Lasers guard the corridor.
Eat rat has been genetically manipulated so it can only see the light of a certain wavelength so to get to the end of the corridor
they must cooperate by calling out "Jump!" to the other rats so they can all safely
jump over all the lasers together.

Originally it was conceived as a multi-machine game. Each player would look at their own screen the machines would be synchronized over the net.
About 60% into development we realized we didn't have time to make it work over the network so instead we made it run on 1 machine showing
3 displays.

To play the game "correctly" requires holding up some kind of barrier between the 3 displays (2 pieces of paper will do)
so that each player can ony see one of the 3 displays.

 * Player 1 presses 'a' to jump
 * Player 2 presses 'b' to jump
 * Player 3 presses 'p' to jump

The plays call out "Jump!" to tell the other players when to jump over the lasers they can see.

By default there are 100 lasers to jump.
